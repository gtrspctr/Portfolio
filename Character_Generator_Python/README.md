# Character_Generator_Python

This project was created by Al Robison just for fun. When ran, it will display a screen where you can choose from four characters with different stats. You can save your character; the data will output to a file in the 'saves' folder for some other use - Perhaps for a future game!

For now, it's just for fun and doesn't have a point.

## Dependencies

This project was written in Python version 3.9.1.

This project requires [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) to work. It was built using version 2.1.2. To install Pygame, use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

Once Python 3.9+ and Pygame are installed, simply run main.py.

The folder structure must remain intact.
